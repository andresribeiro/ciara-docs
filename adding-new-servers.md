# Adding new servers

Ciara allows to deploy on 1 server, or 1000. There's no limit on how many servers you can use.

If you wish to add another server to the pool of servers you have, update your `ciara.config.json`. Then, all you need to do is run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
ciara deploy
```
