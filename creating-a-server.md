# Creating a Server

## Operational System

Ciara requires that you use Debian as your Operational System.

## Configuration

No prior configuration on your server is required. In fact, we recommend that you provide Ciara a server “as is”. In other words, the recommendation is that you create a server and don't modify anything.
