# Creating a server

## Operational System

Ciara requires that you use Flatcar Container Linux as your operating system. You don't need any prior knowledge of it.

You can check how to create an server with Flatcar Container Linux on the following providers:

- [Digital Ocean](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/installing/cloud/digitalocean/)
- [Hetzner](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/installing/cloud/hetzner/)
- [Akamai/Linode](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/installing/cloud/akamai/)
- [Amazon EC2](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/installing/cloud/aws-ec2/)
- [Google Compute Engine](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/installing/cloud/gcp/)

If you have a Bare Metal, you can check the [offical guide](https://www.flatcar.org/docs/latest/#bare-metal).

## Configuration

No prior configuration on your server is required. In fact, we recommend that you provide Ciara a server “as is”. In other words, the recommendation is that you create a server and don't modify anything.
