# Creating a Server

## Operational System

Ciara requires that you use Debian as your Operational System.

## Configuration

No prior configuration on your server is required. In fact, we recommend that you provide Ciara a server “as is”. In other words, the recommendation is that you create a server and don't modify anything.

## SSH

Ciara connects to your server using SSH private keys. Connections via password are not supported and will not be implemented for security reasons.

<Badge type="warning" text="Warning" /> Ciara disables SSH password logins on your server for enhanced security after a successful connection.
