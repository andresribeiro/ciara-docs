# Quickstart

Let's get you up-and-running with Ciara.

## Installation

## Initializing a project

On your project root, run the following command on your terminal:

```bash
ciara init
```

**Output**

```
✔ What is the IP address of the server? 127.0.0.1
✔ Is SSH running on the default port (22)? Yes
✔ What is your SSH user for connecting to the server? root
Successfully created ciara.config.json
```

This command will create an `ciara.config.json` on your project root. We talk more about this file on the next section.
